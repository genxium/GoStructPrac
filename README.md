# Searching for Golang keywords in China
Due to the well-known reason, the official site of Golang is blocked in China by the time of writing. You can search for "godoc <YourKeyword, e.g. json>" or "github golang <YourKeyword>" or "stackoverflow golang <YourKeyword>" instead. Or use the built-in docs like what's suggested in [another repo](https://github.com/genxium/Go111ModulePrac).  

Moreover, reading some suggested ways for using Golang from `https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency` or `<YourLocalGoDocHost>/doc/effective_go.html` is good.
